Anthony Shay
Small Business Owner

	As a small business owner I need something to help organize all the tasks that need to be completed by my employees and myself, 
remind me when they need to be completed, and what level of importance they are. To accomplish this I need to be able to create tasks, 
assign them a time and importance, and be able to tag them with the type of task it is (bill, upkeep â€¦) and who must complete it. The 
app should remind me at the start of every day all the tasks that should be done, and remind me at the start of every week the tasks I 
have labeled as essential. The program should keep track of all tasks and put them into an overdue section I can check if they are not 
marked as completed.
