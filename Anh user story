As a casual user, a student, I want reminder functionality to remind me of upcoming classes and assignment due dates. I want to be able to set reminder at a selectable time frame before the event date/time. I would like to be able to select a date from a displayed calendar and modify that date with details about a certain future class, or event/assignment. I would like the option to set a class to be recurring.
